# About

[Centreon](https://www.centreon.com/en/) Centreon is the choice of some of the world's largest companies and mission-critical organizations for real-time IT performance monitoring and diagnostics.
[Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/) Sikuli automates anything you see on the screen. It uses image recognition to identify and control GUI components. It is useful when there is no easy access to a GUI's internal or source code.

# [Centreon plugin](https://github.com/romseguy/centreon.sikuli/blob/master/check_sikuli)

Runs Sikuli tests from Centreon with these options:

* `-t` test_path
* `-i` lib_path
* `-w` warning_treshold
* `-c` critical_treshold
* `-o` log_file

# [Centreon library](https://github.com/romseguy/centreon.sikuli/blob/master/centreon.sikuli/centreon.py) for Sikuli

Reports Sikuli test results back to Centreon.
See [here](https://github.com/romseguy/centreon.sikuli/blob/master/clickrdp.sikuli/clickrdp.py) for an example.
